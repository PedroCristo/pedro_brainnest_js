## JS1 - Terminology & Definitions

### 1. Name the three ways to declare a variable?
#### The three ways to declare a variable in JavaScript are: `var`,`let` and `const`.

### 2. Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
#### You should avoid using the `var` keyword for variable declarations, as it has functional scope and can lead to unexpected behavior in certain situations. It is recommended to use `let`let or `const` instead.

### 3. What rules should you follow when naming variables?
#### When naming variables in JavaScript, it is important to follow the following rules:
     - The name should start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.
     - The name should only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.
     - The name should not be a reserved word.

### 4. What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings?
#### When using the + operator with numbers and strings, the operator may perform addition or concatenation, depending on the types of the operands. It is important to be mindful of this and to explicitly convert types if necessary.

### 5. How does the % operator work?
#### The `%` operator returns the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second operand.

### 6. Explain the difference between == and ===.
#### The `==` operator performs type coercion before checking equality, while the `===` operator does not perform type coercion and only returns true if the operands are equal in value and type.

### 7. When would you receive a NaN result?
#### A `NaN` result occurs when a mathematical operation cannot be performed, such as dividing `0` by `0`.

### 8. How do you increment and decrement a number?
#### To increment a number, you can use the `++` operator. To decrement a number, you can use the `--` operator.

### 9. Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement operators.
#### The prefix increment/decrement operator (`++x, --x`) increments/decrements the value of a variable before it is used in an expression, while the postfix increment/decrement operator (`x++, x--`) increments/decrements the value of a variable after it is used in an expression.
